abstract = "Scientific claims in biomedical research are typically derived from statistical analyses. However, misuse or misunderstanding of statistical procedures and results permeate the biomedical literature, affecting the validity of those claims. One approach journals have taken to address this issue is to enlist expert statistical reviewers. How many journals do this, how statistical review is incorporated, and how its value is perceived by editors is of interest. Here we report an expanded version of a survey conducted more than 20 years ago by Goodman and colleagues (1998) with the intention of characterizing contemporary statistical review policies at leading biomedical journals. We received eligible responses from 107 of 364 (28%) journals surveyed, mostly from editors in chief. Although about one-third rarely or never use statistical review, the majority have adopted some form of statistical review and about one-quarter employ statistical review for all quantitative research articles. Statistical review was thought to have substantial incremental value over regular peer review. Provision of guidelines or templates to reviewers was relatively uncommon. Sustaining a productive two-way dialogue between the statistical and applied research communities will be essential to sustain and improve the process of statistical review. Meta-research may help to provide empirical grounding for different models of statistical review."
