Whilst some scientists study rocks, insects, brains, or molecules, we study the process of science itself. This *meta-research*, or 'research on research', involves evaluating quality, bias, and efficiency during critical phases of the research cycle, including methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. We take an interdisciplinary approach that seeks to cross-fertilize ideas and resources between fields to most effectively maximise the quality and efficiency of the scientific endeavour. You can take a look at some of our <a href="/publication/">publications</a> to get a flavour of the work that we do.
